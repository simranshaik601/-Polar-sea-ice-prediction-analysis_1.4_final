# -Polar-sea-ice-prediction-analysis_1.4_final


Various dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere are thought to be driving the rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice in recent decades. The freshly open water caused by sea ice melt has a significant impact on the atmosphere.

output column is sea_ice and along with 11 other features need to predict the model for polar sea ice prediction dataset

The input columns are 'u10','v10','cc','msl','precip','GH_mean','RH_mean','cw','hf','sw','lw'
